# CKA - Cluster enviroment

I'm studying for the CKA exam and need a k8s cluster to practice, so why not take advantage of this need and improve my skills with other tools like Terraform and git?

The initial target is to write terraform files to deploy nodes to be used in a Kubernetes cluster in AWS or in a local KVM environment.
