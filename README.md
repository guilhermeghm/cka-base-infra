# CKA - Cluster enviroment

I'm studing for the CKA exam and need an k8s cluster to practice, so why not to take advantage of this need and  improve my skills with other tools like Terraform?

The initial target is to write terraform files to deploy a base kubernetes cluster in AWS and/or in a local KVM enviroment.
